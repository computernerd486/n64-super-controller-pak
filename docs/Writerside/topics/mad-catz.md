# Mad Catz / High Frequency
Similar to the OEM pak form factor and case wise, primary differences:
* Grip Area is not inset, instead having a line pattern to grip
* Uses phillips head screws
* No discernible injection mold markings

This took some research to find, these were made in Hong Kong by Mad Catz, but were also sold branded as "High Frequency"
through Toys'R'Us. There were other versions available in a x4 and x16 versions which include an LCD screen to select between "pages"

### Board
