# Transfer Pack Breakout

There is an existing "transfer pak" which allowed a user to plug a gameboy cartridge into it for use in certain games. 
Pokemon Stadium being one of those game supporting the hardware.

Internally, there is a small breakout board which converts the double-sided 32 pin pcb into a single 30 pin ribbon cable
that then connects to a board that interfaces with the GB cartilages.
